1. What is a hash in Ruby?

Your answer: A hash is simply an object in ruby that contains only key value pairs.

Researched answer: My answer was correct, missed a key detail that ruby hashes are unique in that the order of the keys don't matter.

2. What is a gem?

Researched answer: Ruby on Rails is actually an entire framework that handles a lot of the things done on the backend such as creating models, changing the shapes of databases, and queries.

4. What is a relational database? Are there other kinds of databases?

Your answer: Relational databases is defined in the name, it's a database that associates information with how they are related to each other. I'm not sure about the other types of Databases.

Researched answer: There are apparently 8 types of databases, to include relational databases. They are Centralised, distributed, personal, end-user, commercial, NoSQL, operational, and relational databases. I'm hesitant to dig into them all because I don't want to start confusing myself at this point.

5. What are primary keys? Why are they important?

Your answer: Primary keys are unique identifiers for items in a database table, they are what is referenced as foreign keys when doing active record associations with respect to relational databases.

Researched answer: It's like I said above, they are a special relational database table column used to identify each table entry.
